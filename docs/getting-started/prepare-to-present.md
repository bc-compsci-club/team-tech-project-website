After you and your team have worked on your project, show us all the hard work you put into your project at the next meetup and share the things you learned while working on it, regardless of whether it's finished or not!

## Before The Meetup

A few days before each meetup, a form for registering for presentations will be made available for teams to fill out. All teams that plan to present their project should fill out the form before the day of the meetup.

To register your team to present at the next meetup, fill out the form [here.](https://ttp.bccompsci.club/register-present)

## During the Meetup

Once your team is called to present, your team will have up to 5 minutes to present your project to everyone and answer questions that the audience may have for you. During your presentation, you will be able to tell us about the new skills you learned, the mistakes you learned from, and the feats that you accomplished while working on your project.

Here are some guiding questions to answer during your presentation:

- What was the inspiration behind the project?
- What does your teamâ€™s project do? How does it work?
- What tools and technologies did you and your team use?
- What challenges did you and your team face?
- What accomplishments are you and your team proud of?
- What did you and your team learn during the project?
- Where will you take your project to next?

## After The Meetup

If you and your team presented your project during a meetup, your project will be showcased on the [Team Tech Project gallery](/gallery)! Congratulations!

In addition, outstanding projects that were presented may be featured on the [Team Tech Project home page](/)! Both new and continuing projects can qualify to be an outstanding project for each meetup. Because projects can be outstanding in many ways, there are no fixed guidelines for what is considered to be an outstanding project.
